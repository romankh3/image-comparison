# Contributing to Image-Comparison

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## Did you find a bug?
*   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/romankh3/image-comparison/issues).
*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a [new one](https://github.com/romankh3/image-comparison/issues/new/choose). 
    Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, 
    and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
*   Provide test images, which can be used for reprodusing.
## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
*   Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
*   Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, 
functionality, or testability of Image-Comparison - welcome.
## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
*   Suggest your change in the **Feature request** and wait for approval to avoid writing code, which won't be added.
*   Do not open a Pull-Request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

Thanks! 

Image-Comparison.
