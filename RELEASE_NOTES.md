# Release Notes

## 4.2.0
*   added the ability to ignore some percent of differences for comparison.

## 4.1.0
*   added option to fill rectangles(167 issue)

## 4.0.0
*   refactored drawRectangles method due to SRP.
*   optimized isDifferentPixels to improve algorithm.
*   moved to Apache License 2.0
*   removed Point and used java.awt.Point instead
*   added Gradle.yml for GitHub actions
*   removed commandLine usage
*   renamed ComparisonResult to ImageComparisonResult
*   renamed ComparisonState to ImageComparisonState
*   added own RuntimeException for wrapping checked exception
*   added Gitter chat for communication.

## 3.3.1
*   Fixed bug #134: If image is different in a line in 1 px, ComparisonState is always MATCH
*   Fixed bug #136: deepCopy method throws IllegalArgumentException on shared BufferedImage
*   added GitHub workflow to the project.

## 3.3.0
*   Added option to get the pixels difference percentage between images in case of SIZE_MISMATCH.
*   Fixed NPE for default run from commandLine(#131)
*   Added configuration part to README.md.
## 3.2.0
*   Added ability to change pixel tolerance.
*   Improved algorithm to make it faster.
*   Improved JavaDocs.
*   Researched JPEG images, all work as expected. 

## 3.1.1 
*   Fixed bug #113: RED (not equals) and GREEN (ignored) areas are not shown at result image at the same time

## 3.1.0
*   Added the ability to draw excluded areas on the result image. Rectangles with the differences drawing RED color.
    Rectangles of the excluded areas - GREEN color.

*   Fixed root problem on the algorithm.

*   Added returning `this` for setters in ImageComparison and ComparisonResult.

*   renamed image1 => expected and image2 => actual.

*   Added writeResultTo() for ComparisonResult.

## 3.0.1
*   Fixed #98: Ignored area was not actually ignored.

## 3.0.0
*   Added ComparisonResult as a returning value for comparing. It contains:
    
    *   expected(ex image1)
    
    *   actual(ex image2)
    
    *   ComparisonState, with conditions MATCH, MISMATCH, SIZE_MISMATCH
    
    *   Result image, only if ComparisonState is MISMATCH. When it is MATCH or SIZE_MISMATCH no needs to create result image.
    
*   added minimalRectangleSize and maximalRectangleCount(sorted by rectangle size).

*   Added more tests to cover more test cases.

*   Refactored CommandLineUsage, moved main() method to separated class.

*   Added ExcludedAreas functionality, which helps to exclude some parts of the image.

## 2.2.0
*   Added ability to customize rectangle line width.

*   Moved the main method from Image Comparison to own class.

*   Made non-static threshold field.

*   Added Code of Conduct and Contributing pages.

*   Added Point model.

## 2.1.0
*   Added publishing to JCenter

## 2.0.2
*   fixed bug #11(finally!!)

*   fixed bug #43

## 2.0.1 
*   fixed bug #21

## 2.0
*   use as a library 

## 1.0
*   The program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually by drawing rectangles.*

*   Implementation is using only standard core language and platform features, no 3rd party libraries and plagiarized code is permitted.

*   Pixels (with the same coordinates in two images) can be visually similar, but have
different values of RGB. We are only consider 2 pixels to be "different" if the
difference between them is more than 10%.

*   The output of the comparison is a copy of one of the images image with
differences outlined with red rectangles as shown below.

*   No third party libraries and borrowed code are not using.
