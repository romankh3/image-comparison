## About
The program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually by drawing rectangles. The Usages of the `image-comparison` can be found here [Usage Image Comparison](https://github.com/romankh3/usage-image-comparison)

*   Implementation is using only standard core language and platform features, no 3rd party libraries and plagiarized code is permitted.

*   Pixels (with the same coordinates in two images) can be visually similar, but have different values of RGB. 2 pixels are considered to be "different" if they differ more than 10% from each other.

*   The output of the comparison is a copy of `actual` images. The differences are outlined with red rectangles as shown below.

*   No third party libraries or borrowed code are in usage.

*   Some parts of the image can be excluded from the comparison and drawn in the result image.

## Building
To clone and build this project, run the following commands:
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/romankh3/image-comparison
cd image-comparison
./gradlew check jar
```

This will compile, run the tests, and create a runnable jar at `${projectDir}/build/libs`.

## Release Notes

Can be found in [RELEASE_NOTES](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## Usage

### Using the command-line

This library can be used as a command-line utility to compare two images.

After building with `./gradlew jar`, you will find the runnable jar at `${projectDir}/build/libs`.

To compare two images in files `a.png` and `b.png`, for example, run:

```bash
java -jar image-comparison.jar a.png b.png
```

To save the result image in a third file, say `comparison.png`, just give that file as a third argument:

```bash
java -jar image-comparison.jar a.png b.png comparison.png
```

To show more usage details, run:

```bash
java -jar image-comparison.jar -h
```

### Using as a Java library

#### Dependency
##### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.romankh3</groupId>
    <artifactId>image-comparison</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
##### Gradle
```groovy
compile 'com.github.romankh3:image-comparison:3.0.0'
```

#### To compare two images programmatically
```java
class Example {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
       // load the images to be compared
               BufferedImage expectedImage = ImageComparisonUtil.readImageFromResources("expected.png");
               BufferedImage actualImage = ImageComparisonUtil.readImageFromResources("actual.png");
       
               // where to save the result (leave null if you want to see the result in the UI)
               File resultDestination = new File( "result.png" );
       
               //Create ImageComparison object for it.
               ImageComparison imageComparison = new ImageComparison( expectedImage, actualImage, resultDestination );
       
               //Can be used another constructor for it, without destination.
               new ImageComparison("expected.png", "actual.png");
               //or
               new ImageComparison(expectedImage, actualImage);
       
               //Also can be configured BEFORE comparing next properties:
       
               //Threshold - it's the max distance between non-equal pixels. By default it's 5.
               imageComparison.setThreshold(10);
               imageComparison.getThreshold();
       
               //RectangleListWidth - Width of the line that is drawn in the rectangle. By default it's 1.
               imageComparison.setRectangleLineWidth(5);
               imageComparison.getRectangleLineWidth();
       
               //Destination. Before comparing also can be added destination file for result image.
               imageComparison.setDestination(resultDestination);
               imageComparison.getDestination();
       
               //MaximalRectangleCount - It means that would get first x biggest rectangles for drawing.
               // by default all the rectangles would be drawn.
               imageComparison.setMaximalRectangleCount(10);
               imageComparison.getMaximalRectangleCount();
       
               //MinimalRectangleSize - The number of the minimal rectangle size. Count as (width x height).
               // by default it's 1.
               imageComparison.setMinimalRectangleSize(100);
               imageComparison.getMinimalRectangleSize();
       
               //After configuring the ImageComparison object, can be executed compare() method:
               ComparisonResult comparisonResult = imageComparison.compareImages();
       
               //Can be found ComparisonState.
               ComparisonState comparisonState = comparisonResult.getComparisonState();
               
               //And Result Image
               BufferedImage resultImage = comparisonResult.getResult();
       
               //Image can be saved after comparison, using ImageComparisonUtil.
               ImageComparisonUtil.saveImage(resultDestination, resultImage); 
    }
}
```

## Demo

Run the `./run.sh` script to run the demo.

You will get the result of comparing two images.
The images, which are using:

### Expected Image(ex image1)
